Executes intelligent portfolio rebalancing by analyzing current holdings and executing optimal trades to achieve target asset allocation. This implements sophisticated portfolio optimization logic to minimize trading costs while reaching desired allocation targets.

<use-cases>
- Target allocation rebalancing: currentWine = 60%, targetWine = 40% → sell 20% wine position
- Risk management: Reduce overweight positions and increase underweight assets  
- Strategic reallocation: Shift from art-heavy to real estate-heavy portfolio
- Automated maintenance: Keep portfolio aligned with investment strategy
- Tax-efficient rebalancing: Minimize trades while achieving allocation targets
</use-cases>

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Analyzes current portfolio and calculates optimal trade sequence
- Executes multiple trades automatically to reach target allocation
- Considers trading costs and slippage in optimization calculations
- Requires sufficient trading delegation limits for all planned trades
- May take multiple transactions to complete full rebalancing

Essential for maintaining optimal portfolio allocation, implementing investment strategies, and automated portfolio management with minimal trading costs.
