Identifies profitable price discrepancies between different platforms or trading pairs for the same or equivalent assets. This enables discovery of arbitrage opportunities that can generate risk-free profits through price differences.

<use-cases>
- Cross-platform arbitrage: assetId = "WINE-BORDEAUX", platformA = "splint_invest", platformB = "masterworks"
- Cross-pair arbitrage: Compare WINE/ETH vs WINE/USDC pricing for triangular arbitrage
- Market inefficiency detection: Find temporary price disparities during market volatility
- Profit opportunity analysis: Calculate potential returns from arbitrage execution
- Risk-free trading: Identify opportunities with minimal market risk exposure
</use-cases>

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Read-only analysis with no transaction costs
- Prices can change rapidly - arbitrage windows may close quickly
- Consider transaction fees and gas costs when evaluating profitability
- Large arbitrage trades may move markets and reduce profitability
- Best opportunities often require fast execution

Essential for identifying risk-free profit opportunities, market inefficiency detection, and automated trading strategy development.
