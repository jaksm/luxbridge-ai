Provides liquidity to an automated market maker (AMM) pool by depositing two tokens in exchange for LP (liquidity provider) tokens. This enables users to earn trading fees from the pool while supporting the trading ecosystem.

<use-cases>
- Provide wine/ETH liquidity: tokenA = "0x123...WINE", tokenB = "0x456...ETH", amounts based on current pool ratio
- Add art/real estate liquidity: Cross-RWA pool liquidity for direct trading between asset classes
- Earn trading fees: Receive LP tokens that accumulate fees from all trades in the pool
- Support market making: Help provide liquidity for other users' trades
- Balanced deposits: Provide equal value of both tokens to maintain pool balance
</use-cases>

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Requires equal USD value of both tokens for optimal deposit
- Slippage protection prevents unfavorable deposits during price volatility
- LP tokens represent proportional ownership of the pool
- Earns fees from all trades but exposed to impermanent loss risk
- Must approve both tokens for the AMM contract before calling

Essential for earning passive income from trading fees while supporting the liquidity infrastructure for cross-platform RWA trading.
