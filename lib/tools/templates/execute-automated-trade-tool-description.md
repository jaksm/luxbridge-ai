Immediately executes a previously queued automated trade. This allows for manual triggering of queued trades or can be used by AI agents to execute trades when optimal market conditions are detected.

<use-cases>
- Execute specific trade: tradeId = "0x123...abc" ‚Üí immediately execute the queued trade
- Manual override: Force execution of a queued trade when you see favorable conditions
- AI-triggered execution: AI detects optimal timing and triggers trade execution
- Immediate execution: Execute trade that was queued for later without waiting
- Batch execution: Execute multiple queued trades in sequence
</use-cases>

üö® CRITICAL WARNINGS:

- Trade executes immediately at current market prices
- Cannot be undone once transaction is confirmed
- Must respect original trade parameters including slippage protection
- Will fail if trade deadline has passed or conditions changed unfavorably

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Verifies all delegation permissions and spending limits before execution
- Trade must be within original deadline to be executable
- Market conditions may have changed since trade was queued
- Gas fees apply for transaction execution

Essential for immediate execution of queued trades, AI-driven trade timing, and manual override of automated trading strategies.
